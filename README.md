## 🚀 Floating Window TUI

This fork transforms the persistent sidebar into a **disposable floating window**. Toggle it instantly when you need to check agent status, then dismiss it to keep your workspace clean.

### Features

- **Global Tracking** — Monitors all AI agents across all tmux sessions and windows.
- **Rich Metadata** — Prompts, tool calls, background shell state, and task progress.
- **Git & Worktrees** — Manage worktrees and view Git state directly from the TUI.
- **Minimal Impact** — Runs as a `display-popup` process; no persistent pane required.

## 🔔 Window Bell Notifications

Stay informed without keeping the TUI open. The plugin integrates with tmux's window bell to alert you when an agent requires attention or finishes a task.
