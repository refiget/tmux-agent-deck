description: What the sidebar shows for Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode, side by side.

Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode work with the sidebar, but they expose different sets of hooks — so the sidebar's surface area is narrower for Codex and OpenCode than it is for Claude Code.

## Feature support by agent

| Feature                                  | Claude Code | Codex        | OpenCode     | Notes                                                                                                                           |

| Waiting status + wait reason             | ✓           | —            | ✓            | OpenCode maps permission prompts to waiting notifications; Claude also has `Notification`, `PermissionDenied`, and `TeammateIdle` |
| API failure reason display               | ✓           | —            | ✓            | `StopFailure` is wired only for Claude and OpenCode                                                                             |
| Permission badge                         | ✓ (`plan` / `edit` / `auto` / `!`) | ✓ (`auto` / `!` only) | — | Codex badges are inferred from process arguments; OpenCode does not expose permission modes                                     |
| Git branch display                       | ✓           | ✓            | ✓            | Uses the pane `cwd`; Claude updates dynamically via `CwdChanged`                                                                |

| Task progress                            | ✓           | —            | —            | Requires `PostToolUse`; Codex fires `PostToolUse` only for `Bash`, and OpenCode does not surface task progress                  |

| Worktree lifecycle tracking              | ✓           | —            | —            | Requires `WorktreeCreate` / `WorktreeRemove`                                                                                     |
